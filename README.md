# Chetbot

Chetbot is a simple chatbot system developed by sams331 (me). Chetbot is very simple, it just takes an API request and send it to your desired server. Chetbot is made in DJS (discord.js), so it's pretty accessible.

## Chetbot has the abilities to:
- Chat politely
- Tells you a joke
- Remember your info (name, age, location) if you tell Chetbot

## Things to do:
If you want to use Chetbot, you have to make a Brainshop API. To make it, visit [this site](https://brainshop.ai/). And then, just use [the code](https://github.com/sams331/chetbot) I provided.

## Required packages:
- discord.js
- axios

All of them were accessible in NPM.
